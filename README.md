- 👋  Hi, I'm Jessica (Jessi). I have a varied background. I have two degrees in Percussion Performace and perform as a professional orchestra musician every week with the orchestra in Tampa, Florida.

I have performed with, recorded on, engineered, and produced recordings for various artists in the pop, rock, and classical genres. I also studied accounting and computer science at the University of South Florida. In addition to my performance schedule, I am currently working freelance from my home office and continue to take courses to further my programming skills.
