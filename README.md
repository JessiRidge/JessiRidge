- 👋 Hi, I'm Jessi. I have a varied background. I have two degrees in percussion performace and perform as professional musician with the orchestra in Tampa, Florida. I graduated with a Master of Music degree in Percussion Performance from New England Conservatory in Boston, MA. In addition, I studied accounting and computer science at the University of South Florida. Because my performance schedule is very busy, I am currently taking online courses to further my programming skills.

- 👀 I’m interested in backend web development.
 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning html, css, javascript, and python.
  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that will help me improve my skills and apply for new employment. I'm willing to relocate or work remotely.
